        Hello there. 
        I'm glad you have dropped by to check out my awesome website.
        It has been a long time in coming. 
        I have spent many hours of practice to make it to this point.
        Going forward, I will take some time to talk about 
        some things that are near and dear to my heart.
      </p>

        First and foremost, <em>my wife</em>. 
        She is <strong>beautiful</strong> and <strong>kind</strong> and I love her dearly.
        She is an amazing cook which is why she stole my heart.
        She really takes <strong>GREAT</strong> care of me and keeps a wonderfully clean home.
        She has a wonderful sense of humor and always acts goofy to make me laugh.

        Secondly, <em>my daughter Olive.</em>. My bright and shining star. 
        She is growing up so <strong>fast</strong>. 
        Every day I come home I am so excited to see her smile. 
        She always greets me with a big grin.
        She is so smart and learns so fast. I am <em><strong>so proud of her</strong></em>. 
        Even her stubborness and crankiness are somehow loveable.

        Okay, that is probably enough for now.
        I need to run this to make sure it formats how I'm hoping it will.
        Thank you for stopping by to take a peak at my page. 
        Come back soon to witness my progress!
